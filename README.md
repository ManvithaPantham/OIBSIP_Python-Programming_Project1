# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_Project1
🎙️ Smart Python Voice Assistant – from simple commands to NLP-powered task automation and API integrations.

## 📖 About the Project
This project is a **Voice Assistant built using Python**, developed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP) – Python Programming**.  
It introduces **beginners** to basic speech recognition while offering an **advanced version** with NLP and API integrations for real-world task automation.  

## ✨ Features
### 🚀 Advanced Version
- Sends **emails** using voice commands.
- Sets **reminders**.
- Provides **weather updates** via APIs.
- Answers **general knowledge questions**.
- Controls **smart devices** (IoT integration).
- Allows **custom commands** and third-party API integrations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `datetime`
  - `webbrowser`
  - `smtplib`
  - `requests` (for APIs)
  - `nltk` / `spacy` (for NLP)
  - 
📝 Steps Performed


Extended Libraries — integrated smtplib, requests, nltk/spacy for NLP.

Email — added SMTP auth flow to send emails by voice.

Reminders — simple store & notify logic for time-based prompts.

Weather — fetched current weather via API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

General Knowledge — added knowledge lookups (e.g., Wikipedia API).

Smart Devices (placeholders) — structured functions for future IoT control.

Custom Commands — mapped voice intents to actions via rules/keywords.

Robust Errors — covered mic access, API failures, invalid inputs.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Working with speech recognition and text-to-speech.

Building task automation with Python.

Using APIs and NLP for intent handling.

Handling errors & edge cases in voice apps.
