# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_Project1
🎙️ Smart Python Voice Assistant – from simple commands to NLP-powered task automation and API integrations.

## 📖 About the Project
This project is a **Voice Assistant built using Python**, developed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP) – Python Programming**.  
It introduces **beginners** to basic speech recognition while offering an **advanced version** with NLP and API integrations for real-world task automation.  

## ✨ Features
### 🚀 Advanced Version
- Sends **emails** using voice commands.
- Sets **reminders**.
- Provides **weather updates** via APIs.
- Answers **general knowledge questions**.
- Controls **smart devices** (IoT integration).
- Allows **custom commands** and third-party API integrations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `datetime`
  - `webbrowser`
  - `smtplib`
  - `requests` (for APIs)
  - `nltk` / `spacy` (for NLP)
##Learning Outcomes
Working with speech recognition.
Building task automation scripts.
Using APIs and NLP.
Handling errors & edge cases.
📝 Steps Performed
Extended Libraries – Integrated smtplib for emails, requests for APIs, and nltk/spacy for Natural Language Processing.
Email Functionality – Allowed sending emails using SMTP authentication.
Reminders – Implemented reminder storage and notification logic.
Weather Updates – Connected to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.
General Knowledge Q&A – Added API integration (like Wikipedia/other knowledge APIs) to fetch answers.
Smart Device Control (optional) – Designed placeholder functions for IoT integration.
Custom Commands – Allowed users to add their own voice commands mapped to actions.
Robust Error Handling – Managed microphone issues, API failures, and invalid inputs.
